Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
This project aims to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The analysis leverages a comprehensive online retail dataset and employs robust data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to deliver actionable business insights.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict customer lifetime value (CLV) for an online retail business using historical transaction data.

Techniques Used: Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, regression modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest), and performance evaluation.

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Google Colab.

Dataset Information
Source: The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle: Online Retail Dataset.

Access: For the purposes of this project, the dataset was uploaded to my Google Drive. The dataset path referenced in the project notebook points to this location in Google Drive.

Custom Usage: If you wish to run this project on your local machine, please download the dataset from the Kaggle link above and update the dataset path in the code accordingly.

Project Structure
Data Loading & Cleaning:
The dataset is loaded from Google Drive and undergoes thorough cleaning, including:

Removing records with missing customer IDs

Filtering out invalid quantities and prices

Excluding canceled orders

Feature engineering, such as calculating total transaction value and converting date columns

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Comprehensive EDA is performed to uncover key business insights, including:

Top countries by transactions and revenue

Monthly sales trends

Transaction value distributions

Customer purchase behaviors and segmentation

Model Building:
Multiple regression models are trained and evaluated to predict CLV, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Performance metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² score are reported

Visualization:
The project includes a suite of visualizations to illustrate data distributions, trends, and model results.
