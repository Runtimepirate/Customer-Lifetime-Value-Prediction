# üõçÔ∏è Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

This project aims to **predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using historical transaction data from an online retail business. It leverages **data analytics** and **machine learning** to extract valuable business insights and provide predictive power for future customer behavior. The analysis leverages a comprehensive online retail dataset and employs robust data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to deliver actionable business insights.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Load dataset from Google Drive
- Remove entries with missing `CustomerID`
- Filter out negative or zero `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`
- Exclude canceled (`InvoiceNo` starts with "C") transactions
- Feature engineering:
  - Calculate `TotalTransactionValue`
  - Convert date columns appropriately

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze top-performing countries by sales
- Monthly transaction trends
- Distribution of transaction values
- Customer segmentation and behavioral patterns

### 3. Model Building
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R¬≤ Score

### 4. Visualization
- Revenue and transaction heatmaps
- Distribution plots
- Prediction vs. Actual CLV scatterplots
